<h1>How to install PageSigner on Chrome</h1>
<br>
<p> First, make sure your Chrome is up to date (it will probably work with recent versions, but this is advisable).</p>
<p> Download <a href="https://tlsnotary.org/103.zip">this zip file.</a> This is PageSigner extension for Chrome</p>
<p> Open 2 new tabs 'chrome://extensions' and 'chrome://downloads' (without the quotes). </p>
<p> In chrome://downloads grab 103.zip and drag it to the Extensions tab. When Extensions tab becomes active, drop the zip file inside of it.</p>

<br>

<p>When you've done that, you'll see the pagesigner entry in the extensions tab created. You'll also see the pagesigner logo (blue signing logo) in the top right of the Chrome window. Head over to that and click it, and you'll be prompted thusly:</p>

<br>

<p> Go ahead and do what it says. This will bring up the 'Add helper app to Chrome' dialog (with some fancy screenshots) like this:</p>

<br>
<p>Click 'Add to Chrome' (the big blue button). You'll get prompted: </p>
<br>

<br>
<p> Click 'Add'. This will bring up a new dialog 'Launch'. You can ignore (close) that. You're done! PageSigner is installed and should be working immediately. To test, browse to a new page (don't use a page that was already loaded before PageSigner), and you should be able to choose 'Notarize this page' from the PageSigner menu:</p>
