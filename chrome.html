<h1>How to install PageSigner on Chrome</h1>
<br>
<p> First, make sure your Chrome is up to date (it will probably work with recent versions, but this is advisable).</p>
<p> Download <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pagesigner/abblaaeblmamacadkdmnejjikbdkemcj?hl=en">PageSigner extension</a> for Chrome</p>
<p> You're done! PageSigner is installed and should be working immediately. To test, browse to a new page (don't use a page that was already loaded before PageSigner), and you should be able to choose 'Notarize this page' from the PageSigner menu:</p>

<p><b>Happy notarizing!</b></p>
